A questionably accurate clone of the Atari 2600 game Berzerk.

To build:
Copy [the devkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCZMrLskYvqUjY0xSBgWxL480l6qFmBl/view?usp=sharing) to your C: drive
and run "build.bat" (note that you'll have to change line 5 of build.bat to point to your current directory).
